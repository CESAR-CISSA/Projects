## CTI Research Projects

This repository showcases ongoing research initiatives focused on advancing Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) capabilities. Our projects leverage cutting-edge AI, particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), to address critical challenges in detecting, analyzing, and responding to sophisticated cyber threats, with a strong emphasis on ransomware and malicious user behavior.

### Projects

#### Xeque Mate - Agent (2025 - Present)
   
This project develops an intelligent agent powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically trained on ransomware data and integrated with existing security platforms. It aims to enhance the detection, contextual analysis, and response to ransomware attacks, making Security Operations Centers (SOCs) more agile and adaptive against the complexity and polymorphism of modern threats. *

#### Xeque Mate - Aggregator (2025 - Present)


This initiative proposes an intelligent cybersecurity data aggregator designed to combat the increasing complexity of threats. The solution will collect, integrate, clean, and semantically enrich data from diverse sources (logs, alerts, IoCs, reports, threat intelligence) to create high-quality datasets. These datasets will feed Large Language Models (LLMs) and other advanced AI to enable the identification of complex and contextual patterns, significantly enhancing threat detection and response in SOCs.

#### Identification and Interpretation of Malicious User Behavior and Cybercrime-Related Deviations (2024 - Present)

This research focuses on two critical challenges for business and risk analysts: detecting complex, hidden behavioral deviations and identifying the root causes of anomalous employee behavior tied to malware and ransomware franchises. It addresses the limitations of current methods in identifying multi-dimensional process anomalies.
